# regexEngine
Contains code and Documentation for a Regex Engine

That code implements a regular expression matcher that handles these constructs:

        c    matches any literal character c
        .    matches any single character
        ^    matches the beginning of the input string
        $    matches the end of the input string
        *    matches zero or more occurrences of the previous character
